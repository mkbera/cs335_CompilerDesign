Source language :- Java
Implementation language :- NODE.JS
Target language :- x86 assembly language

The "src" folder contains the required code for converting source language to
machine language.
The machine and ircode code generated are stored in folders "out/codegen" and 
"out/irgen" respectively.

-------------------------------- FILES DESCRIPTION -------------------------------

includes/tokens.jison		:	Contains   the	 required	tokens	 for   lexer
includes/grammar.jison		:	Contains the grammar  and tokens used  by  jison
								for buiding  the parser along with the  semantic
								actions for each rule
src/irgen.js   				:   Uses the generated	parser to parse the	required
								test file
symbol-table.js				:	contains   the   class   symboltable   with  the
								structure of the  symbol table and functions for
								building the symbol table.

assembly.js					:	Contains the assembly class with constructs to add 
								individual assembly code instructions to assembly 
								object and also to indent them.

components.js				:	Contains the classes for variables, functions and 
								arrays declared in the 3AC.

descriptor.js				:	Descibes the keywords and the operations that our
 								3AC implements.

registers.js				:	Contains the list of registers to be used and the 
								class Registers with methods to get registers and 
								unload registers and variables.

tac.js						:	Defines the functions to generate the list of 
								variables, functions, arrays, nextUseTable and 
								basic blocks from the 3AC.

translate.js				:	Translates the 3AC to assembly code.



---------------------------------- TOOLS USED ----------------------------------

For this assignment, we have made use of 'jison' which is available as	an	open
source plugin for node.js.	The docs are  available  at  'https://zaa.ch/jison/'




------------------------------- RUNNING THE CODE -------------------------------

In order to run the code, first you need to generate the proper binaries using
make. Change the directory to asgn2/ and call make

   make

In order to translate from an test IR file, execute the following command to run
the code:

   bin/codegen test/test.ir [output-file (optional)]

We have provided many test cases in the test folder. An interesting one is the
"sort.ir" which provides an IR code for bubble sort (a working implementation).
We also provide a file "sort-custom.asm" which provides the optimal Assembly code
for the same. When we generate the code from our code generate, we get 9 extra
lines of code, and only one extra unnecessary store. This shows the optimal
nature of the code generated by our algorithm.
